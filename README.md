# generator-ng-electron [![NPM version]

> Generator for an Electron wrapper app around an Angular web app.

Wraps an Angular application (you'll be prompted for a GitHub repository) with our custom [electron-boilerplate](https://github.com/TricomB2B/electron-boilerplate). Makes setup of this process a breeze.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

This generator is currently not available on the NPM registry. So you must clone and link manually:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:TricomB2B/generator-ng-electron.git ~/Projects/generator-ng-electron
$ cd ~/Projects/generator-ng-electron
$ yarn
.... stuff happening
$ npm link
```

## Usage

Generate your new project:

```sh
$ mkdir ~/Projects/great-project
$ cd ~/Projects/great-project
$ yo ng-electron
```

You'll be prompted for the necessary information. The generator will

- Download the electron-boilerplate.
- Install your Angular application to the correct location.
- Make the necessary file edits to make the web app work within Electron.
- Install electron-boilerplate dependencies.
- Start a dev instance of the app.

Super easy.
